                    <p class="description">
                        I started this project in September of 2020. Due to the Pandemic it has
                        been challenging to interact with my friends and I wanted to contact them. The conventional
                        method would be a email, call, text, or facetime, but isn't more interesting
                        to send a letter? Throughout that time I wrote some letters and made postcards for my special friend. 
                        These are the post cards I've made through that time period. Letters remind me of countless stories I've 
                        heard when I was little (Kiki's Delivery Service and Balto the Sled Dog). I was also super inspired by Ragnar Kjartansson's 
                        "Postcards to Marguerite". I viewed them at my first visit to a museum and it was touching. The walls were filled with 
                        postcards with colorful and mesmerizing illustrations. I hope you enjoy my version!
